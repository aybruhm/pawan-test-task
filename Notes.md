# Task Duration: 30 mins

Create a simple TODO list application using Django. The application should have the following features:

* User Authentication: Users should be able to register and log in.

* TODO List: Authenticated users should be able to create, view, edit, and delete TODO items. Each TODO item should have a title, description, and a completion status.
(You can create the interface using bootstrap. Nothing too fancy.)

* List View: Display the list of TODO items in a paginated view, showing only the title and completion status.

* Admin Panel: There should be an admin panel accessible only to superusers. Superusers should be able to manage TODO items through the admin panel.

Publish the code in public github repo and send me the link.
